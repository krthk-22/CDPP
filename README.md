# Conceptualisation and Design of Permutation Puzzles
This repository contains the puzzles that we created and explored as a part of the CDPP Project (Conceptualisation and Design of Permutation Puzzles)

## Introduction

---

Absolutely! 😊 Permutation puzzles are like little brain teasers that keep our minds engaged and entertained. Let's break down some of the fascinating aspects of these puzzles:

1. **Rubik's Cube** 🧩:
   - The Rubik's Cube is a classic example of a permutation puzzle. It's like a colorful, twisty enigma that challenges our spatial reasoning.
   - Each face of the cube has nine smaller cubes (called "cubies") with different colors. The goal? Make each face a single color.
   - Fun fact: There are over 43 quintillion possible combinations, but only one solution! 🌟

2. **15 Puzzle** 🎲:
   - The 15 Puzzle (also known as the "Gem Puzzle" or "Boss Puzzle") is a sliding tile game.
   - It consists of a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles from 1 to 15, plus an empty space.
   - The objective? Slide the tiles around to arrange them in numerical order (usually from 1 to 15).
   - It's deceptively simple yet surprisingly tricky!

3. **Variants and Creativity** 🌈:
   - We inspired by the 15-puzzle created various variants of if and explored them.
   - Creating your own variants of permutation puzzles is like being a puzzle artist. 🎨
   - You can tweak the rules, change the grid size, or even invent entirely new mechanics.
   - Maybe a 5x5 grid with letters instead of numbers? Or a circular puzzle? The possibilities are endless!
   - You can try out various variants and enjoy your time puzzling.

4. **Mathematics and Algorithms** ➗:
   - Permutation puzzles have deep connections to mathematics and computer science.
   - Algorithms for solving them involve group theory, graph theory, and clever strategies.
   - It's like unraveling a mathematical mystery!

So, fellow puzzle adventurer, let's dive into the world of twists, turns, and brain-bending challenges! 🚀 Feel free to explore, create, and unravel the mysteries of permutation puzzles. Happy puzzling! 🧠✨

And remember, even if you get stuck, it's all part of the fun! 🙌🏼🎉
