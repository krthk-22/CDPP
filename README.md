# Conceptualisation and Design of Permutation Puzzles
This repository contains the puzzles that we created and explored as a part of the CDPP Project (Conceptualisation and Design of Permutation Puzzles)

## Introduction

---

Permutation puzzles are a fascinating category of puzzles that involve rearranging elements in a specific order to solve a given problem. These puzzles challenge our logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. One popular example of a permutation puzzle is the Rubik's Cube. The cube consists of smaller cubes that can be rotated to change their positions. The objective is to solve the puzzle by bringing all the colors on each face of the cube into a uniform pattern. Another well-known permutation puzzle is the 15 Puzzle. It consists of a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. The tiles can be moved horizontally or vertically to rearrange them and form a specific order, usually from 1 to 15.

Permutation puzzles have been studied extensively in mathematics and computer science. They have applications in various fields, including cryptography, algorithms, and game theory. Solving permutation puzzles can help improve our problem-solving abilities and enhance our understanding of combinatorial mathematics.

We got inspired from the 15-puzzle and created our own variants of it. We created our own game for trying out our variants. You can also try them out and create your own variants.

Feel free to explore the puzzles in this repository and try solving them. You can also contribute your own permutation puzzles or solutions to existing puzzles. Let's dive into the world of permutation puzzles and unleash our problem-solving potential!

Happy puzzling!
